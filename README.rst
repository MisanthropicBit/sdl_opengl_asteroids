Asteroids clone in C++, SDL and OpenGL
======================================

An old project I made for learning SDL and OpenGL. Asteroids are sliced into two new
asteroids instead of breaking into two smaller, similarly shaped asteroids as in the
original Asteroids game.

Controls
--------

[UP]   : Thrust forward in facing direction
[LEFT] : Rotate left
[RIGHT]: Rotate right
[x]    : Shoot
[d]    : Toggle debug lines
[w]    : Toggle wire-frame mode
[ESC]  : Return to main menu

You can watch a short `YouTube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26Lo8ls_6U>`_ of the game, or
