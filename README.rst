Asteroids clone in C++, SDL and OpenGL
======================================

An old project I made for learning SDL and OpenGL. Asteroids are sliced into two new
asteroids instead of breaking into two smaller, similarly shaped asteroids as in the
original Asteroids game.

Here are some sceenshots from the game. The main menu:
